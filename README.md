  <p align="center">
    This is Hive-Cam! A lightweight computer vision model for honeybee tracking and counting.
    Like a doorbell camera for your beehive, this model keeps track of how many bees are entering and exiting the hive entrance over time.

# 🐝 About the Project
This project seeks to develop and deploy a computer vision model that can be used by the general public to gather information about bee foraging activity in a variety of places, seasons, and contexts.
The way Hive-Cam works is:

👉 Upload a video of your hive entrance

👉 Hive-Cam will automatically identify, track, and count the bees as they fly in and out

👉 See trends in bee foraging activity over time:

# 🗺️ Roadmap
For initial release:
- [x] Get YOLO-based bee detection off the ground
- [x] Work out how to track bees across video frames effectively
- [x] Develop a simple GUI and compile to a usable app
- [x] Publish the GitHub repo
- [ ] Write up project report for reference
🥳🥳🥳
For future development:
- [ ] Test performance on a variety of contexts and hive-types
- [ ] Add functionality to track different classes of honeybees (add 'pollen bee' and 'drone')
- [ ] Attempt to optimise speed, particularly for longer video file integration
- [ ] Build a more professional and comprehensive app interface
